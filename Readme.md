# Hello World in Go

A minimal Go program to print "Hello, World!" to the terminal.  
This project is part of my learning journey from Python to Go, documented in my **Go Beginner Toolkit**.

---

## 📋 Overview
This project demonstrates:
- How to create a simple Go program
- How to run Go code from the terminal
- How to build and run an executable

---

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Go 1.24+ installed  
- Linux, macOS, or Windows terminal  
- Git (to clone the repo)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>
### 2. Run directly with Go
```bash
go run main.go

### 3. Build and run as executable
```bash
go build main.go
./main
Expected output
Hello, World!

### What I Learned
Go requires all code to be inside a package (in this case, main for executables).

The main() function is the program's entry point.
